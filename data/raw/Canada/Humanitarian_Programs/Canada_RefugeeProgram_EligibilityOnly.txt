Country: Canada
Program Type: Refugee Resettlement (Permanent Residence)

1. Overview
The Refugee Resettlement Program allows Canada to offer protection and permanent residence to individuals and families who are outside their home countries and cannot return due to persecution, war, or severe human rights violations.  
Refugees under this program are selected abroad and brought to Canada either through government assistance or private sponsorship. The goal is to provide a durable solution for people facing life-threatening situations who have no safe alternative.

2. Basic Eligibility Requirements
- The applicant must be **referred by a recognized referral organization**, such as the **United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)**, or another **approved referral partner** recognized by Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC).  
- The applicant must qualify under **one of the two main refugee classes** defined by Canadian immigration law:  
  • **Convention Refugee Abroad Class** – Individuals outside their home country who cannot return due to a **well-founded fear of persecution** based on race, religion, nationality, political opinion, or membership in a particular social group.  
  • **Country of Asylum Class** – Individuals outside their home country who are seriously affected by **civil war, armed conflict, or persistent human rights violations** and lack the protection of their home country.  
- The applicant must demonstrate that **no other durable solution exists**, such as voluntary repatriation to their home country, integration in another country, or adequate protection elsewhere.  

3. Admissibility Requirements
- All applicants must be **admissible to Canada**, which includes passing:  
  • **Medical examination** to ensure they do not pose a public health risk.  
  • **Security screening** for any risks related to national security or terrorism.  
  • **Criminal background checks** to confirm no serious criminal history.  
- Admissibility applies to both the **principal applicant** and **accompanying family members**.

4. Sponsorship Pathways
- Refugees may be resettled to Canada under one of the following pathways:  
  • **Government-Assisted Refugee (GAR) Program** – Financial support and initial resettlement services provided by the Government of Canada for up to one year.  
  • **Private Sponsorship of Refugees (PSR) Program** – Sponsorship by Canadian citizens, permanent residents, or community organizations who assume financial and emotional support responsibilities.  
  • **Blended Visa Office-Referred (BVOR) Program** – Shared support between private sponsors and the Government of Canada.  

5. Ineligibility Conditions
- Individuals already recognized as refugees by another country and able to stay there permanently are not eligible for resettlement to Canada.  
- Persons who voluntarily re-established themselves in their home country after fleeing are not eligible.  
- Individuals found inadmissible for **serious criminality**, **human rights violations**, or **security reasons** under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA) cannot be resettled.  

6. Evaluation Factors
When reviewing eligibility, IRCC and referral organizations assess:  
- The **severity and credibility of persecution or risk**.  
- The **availability of durable solutions** in other countries.  
- The **applicant’s ability to successfully resettle and integrate** in Canada.  
- Family composition, vulnerability (e.g., women at risk, medical needs), and other humanitarian factors.
