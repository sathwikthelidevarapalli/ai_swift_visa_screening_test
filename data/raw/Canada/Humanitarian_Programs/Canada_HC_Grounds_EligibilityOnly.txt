Country: Canada
Program Type: Humanitarian and Compassionate (H&C) Grounds – Permanent Residence Pathway

1. Overview
The Humanitarian and Compassionate (H&C) Grounds program allows individuals who would not normally be eligible to become permanent residents of Canada to apply for an exemption from specific requirements of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA) based on compelling humanitarian factors.  
This program is designed for individuals who face exceptional personal circumstances and where removal from or denial of residence in Canada would cause undue hardship.

2. Basic Eligibility Requirements
- The applicant must be **applying for permanent residence in Canada** or for a **permanent resident visa from abroad** on **humanitarian and compassionate grounds**.  
- Applicants **already in Canada** may request consideration for an exemption from standard IRPA requirements if they can show that **exceptional circumstances** justify the request.  
- Applicants must demonstrate **compelling reasons for consideration**, such as:  
  • Strong establishment and integration into Canadian society.  
  • Family ties in Canada.  
  • The best interests of any children directly affected by the decision.  
  • Hardship or adverse conditions in the applicant’s home country.  
- The application must clearly explain why the applicant should be granted an exemption from the usual legal and regulatory requirements of immigration selection.

3. Ineligibility Conditions
- Individuals **cannot apply** for H&C consideration if:  
  • They currently have a **pending refugee claim** before the Immigration and Refugee Board (IRB).  
  • They received a **negative decision** from the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) or **Pre-Removal Risk Assessment (PRRA)** within the past **12 months**, unless an exception applies.  
- Exceptions may be made if:  
  • There are **children under 18** directly affected by the situation, or  
  • The applicant or a family member faces a **serious medical condition** creating exceptional hardship.

4. Application Limitations
- Only **one H&C application** may be **submitted at a time**.  
- Applicants **cannot apply for multiple H&C cases simultaneously**.  
- Submitting a new H&C application while one is pending will result in the previous one being closed.

5. Evaluation Factors
- Officers assessing H&C applications consider:  
  • The degree of **establishment** and **integration** in Canada (employment, education, community involvement).  
  • **Family relationships** in Canada and abroad.  
  • **Best interests of children** affected by the decision.  
  • **Health considerations**, risk of hardship, or lack of access to medical care in the home country.  
  • Any **human rights concerns**, discrimination, or gender-based risks in the applicant’s country of origin.  

6. Legal and Policy References

- **Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations (IRPR)**.  
- **Government of Canada – Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC)** Policy Guidelines on H&C Applications.  

7. Notes
- Approval under H&C grounds is **discretionary**, based on the unique facts of each case.  
- A positive decision grants **permanent resident status**, not a temporary visa.  
- H&C applications may take several months or more to process depending on complexity.  
- Applicants are encouraged to provide comprehensive documentation supporting hardship and integration claims.  
- Applicants must **maintain legal status** in Canada where possible until a decision is made.
