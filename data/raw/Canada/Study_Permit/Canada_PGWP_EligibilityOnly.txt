Permit Type: Post-Graduation Work Permit (PGWP)

1. Overview
The Post-Graduation Work Permit (PGWP) allows eligible international students who have graduated from a designated Canadian post-secondary institution to gain valuable Canadian work experience.  
This program helps graduates transition from study to work and may support future applications for permanent residence through economic immigration pathways.

2. Basic Eligibility Requirements
- The applicant must have **completed a study program** at a **PGWP-eligible Designated Learning Institution (DLI)** in Canada.  
- The program of study must have been **at least 8 months long** and lead to a **degree, diploma, or certificate**.  
- The applicant must have **maintained full-time student status** during each academic session of the program, except possibly in the final semester.  
- The applicant must **apply for the PGWP within 180 days** of receiving written confirmation of completing their program (e.g., transcript or completion letter).  
- The applicant must have held a **valid study permit** at some point during the 180-day period after completing studies and before applying.  
- The applicant must **not have previously been issued a PGWP**.  

3. Eligible Institutions and Programs
- Only programs completed at **PGWP-eligible Designated Learning Institutions (DLIs)** qualify.  
- The following types of institutions are typically eligible:  
  • Public post-secondary institutions (colleges, universities, CEGEPs in Quebec).  
  • Private post-secondary institutions operating under the same rules as public institutions in Quebec.  
  • Private secondary or post-secondary schools in Quebec that offer qualifying vocational training programs of at least 900 hours.  
- Programs that are **ineligible** for the PGWP include:  
  • English or French as a Second Language (ESL/FSL) courses.  
  • General interest or self-improvement courses.  
  • Programs completed at non-DLI institutions.

4. Validity Period
- The PGWP may be issued for a duration **equal to the length of the study program**, up to a **maximum of three years**.  
- For programs between 8 months and 2 years, the permit length matches the duration of the study program.  
- For programs of 2 years or more, the PGWP may be valid for **up to 3 years**.  
- Graduates of more than one eligible program may combine program lengths if the total study time equals at least 8 months.

5. Application Process
1. Receive official written confirmation (e.g., transcript or letter) from the DLI confirming successful program completion.  
2. Apply for the PGWP **within 180 days** using the IRCC online portal.  
3. Ensure that the applicant held **valid temporary resident status** or applied for restoration of status if expired.  
4. Submit the required documents: proof of completion, study permit copy, passport, and recent photos.  
5. Pay the required fees (work permit + open work permit holder fee).  

6. Work Authorization
- Graduates who apply for a PGWP **while their study permit is still valid** may begin working full-time while waiting for a decision.  
- The PGWP is an **open work permit**, allowing the holder to work for **any employer in Canada** and in **any occupation**.
