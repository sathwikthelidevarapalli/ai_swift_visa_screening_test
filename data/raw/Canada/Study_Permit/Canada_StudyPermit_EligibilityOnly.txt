1. Overview
A Canadian Study Permit is an official document issued by Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) that allows foreign nationals to study at Designated Learning Institutions (DLIs) in Canada.  
It authorizes students to remain in Canada for the duration of their academic program and, in some cases, to work part-time during studies. The study permit is not a visa but is often issued together with a temporary resident visa or electronic travel authorization (eTA).

2. Basic Eligibility Requirements
- The applicant must be **enrolled or accepted at a Designated Learning Institution (DLI)** in Canada.  
- The applicant must demonstrate **adequate financial capacity** to cover:  
  • Tuition fees.  
  • Living expenses for themselves and any accompanying family members.  
  • Return transportation costs to their home country.  
- The applicant must have **no criminal record** and must obey Canadian law.  
- A **police certificate** may be required to prove good character and admissibility.  
- The applicant must be **in good health** and may need to undergo a **medical examination** if requested.  
- The applicant must **satisfy the visa officer** that they will **leave Canada at the end of their authorized stay**, typically upon completion of studies or expiry of the study permit.

3. Financial Requirements
Applicants must provide proof of funds, which can include:  
- Proof of a Canadian bank account in the applicant’s name (if money has been transferred to Canada).  
- Guaranteed Investment Certificate (GIC) from a participating Canadian financial institution.  
- Proof of student loan or bank statements covering several months.  
- Proof of payment of tuition and accommodation fees.  
- Letter of financial support from parents, sponsors, or scholarship providers.  

The **minimum financial requirement** is based on IRCC’s annual cost-of-living estimates for international students and their dependents.

4. Additional Conditions
- Applicants must show evidence of **strong ties to their home country** (e.g., employment, family, or property) to demonstrate temporary intent.  
- Students must comply with all **study permit conditions**, including maintaining full-time enrollment and progress toward program completion.  
- Applicants must not be inadmissible for reasons such as security, health, or prior immigration violations.

5. Validity and Extensions
- A study permit is generally valid for the **duration of the study program plus 90 days**, allowing time to prepare to leave Canada or extend status.  
- Extensions can be requested if the applicant continues studies or transfers to another DLI.  
- A new study permit is required to move to a different education level (e.g., from college to university).

6. Work Authorization
- Full-time students enrolled at a DLI may be eligible to **work up to 20 hours per week off-campus** during academic sessions and **full-time during scheduled breaks** without a separate work permit.  
- Work authorization is indicated on the study permit.  
- Some academic programs require **co-op or internship work permits** as part of the curriculum.

7. Documentation Required
- **Letter of acceptance** from a Designated Learning Institution (DLI).  
- **Proof of financial support** (bank statements, scholarships, or sponsorships).  
- **Valid passport or travel document.**  
- **Letter of explanation** (study plan) describing purpose and temporary intent.  
- **Police certificate** and **medical exam** (if applicable).  
- **Photographs** and **biometrics** for visa processing.  

8. Common Reasons for Ineligibility
- Failure to prove sufficient funds for tuition and living costs.  
- Weak academic plan or unclear study purpose.  
- Lack of intent to return home after studies.  
- Submission of incomplete or fraudulent documentation.  
- Criminal or immigration violations making the applicant inadmissible.
