Permit Type: Co-op / Internship Work Permit (for international students)

1. Overview
The Co-op or Internship Work Permit allows eligible international students studying in Canada to gain practical work experience as part of their academic program.  
This permit authorizes students to work full-time during their co-op or internship placement when the work component is an essential and mandatory part of their program at a Designated Learning Institution (DLI).

2. Basic Eligibility Requirements
- The applicant must hold a **valid study permit** at the time of application.  
- The work placement must be an **integral and required component** of the academic program offered by a Designated Learning Institution (DLI).  
- The **co-op or internship component** must not exceed **50% of the total duration** of the study program.  
- The applicant must obtain a **letter from the DLI** confirming that the work placement is mandatory to complete the program.  
- The applicant must apply for and receive a **separate Co-op Work Permit** before beginning the internship or placement.  

3. Ineligibility Conditions
Applicants are **not eligible** for a Co-op or Internship Work Permit if they are:  
- Enrolled only in **English or French as a Second Language (ESL/FSL)** courses.  
- Enrolled in **general interest programs** or **preparatory programs** not linked to a degree, diploma, or certificate requirement.  
- Participating in **short-term or optional work placements** that are not part of a structured academic curriculum.

4. Application Process
- The student’s Designated Learning Institution must provide a **confirmation letter** indicating that the work experience is a mandatory component of the academic program.

5. Work Conditions and Duration

- It is **employer-specific**, meaning students may work only in the position or location related to their study program.

- Students may also work part-time on campus or off-campus under their regular **study permit**, if authorized.

6. Required Documentation
