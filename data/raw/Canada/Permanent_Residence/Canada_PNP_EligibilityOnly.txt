Country: Canada
Program Type: Provincial Nominee Program (PNP) – Permanent Residence Pathway

1. Overview
The Provincial Nominee Program (PNP) allows Canadian provinces and territories to nominate individuals who possess the skills, education, and work experience necessary to contribute to the economic growth and development of that specific region.  
Through this program, each province or territory can design its own immigration streams targeting local labor market needs, such as skilled workers, business owners, graduates, or semi-skilled workers.

Successful nominees may apply for **permanent residence in Canada** through either a direct provincial stream or an Express Entry–aligned pathway.

2. Basic Eligibility Requirements
- The applicant must possess **skills, education, and work experience** that will positively contribute to the **economy of the nominating province or territory**.  
- The applicant must **intend to live and settle** in the province or territory that issues the nomination.  
- The applicant must receive an **official nomination certificate** from a Canadian province or territory under one of its PNP streams.  
- Each province and territory has its own **specific eligibility criteria**, such as occupation lists, work experience thresholds, or language proficiency requirements.

3. Pathways to Apply
There are two primary pathways under which an applicant can pursue permanent residence through the PNP:

**1. Non–Express Entry Stream:**  
- Apply directly to a province or territory for nomination.  
- Upon receiving a nomination, submit a **paper-based application** for permanent residence to Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC).  
- Processing times are longer than Express Entry, and applicants must meet **provincial eligibility criteria** but do not need to meet federal economic class program standards.  

**2. Express Entry–Aligned Stream:**  
- Create an **Express Entry profile** and indicate interest in specific provinces or territories.  
- Receive a **Notification of Interest (NOI)** or direct nomination through the Express Entry system.  
- Must meet the eligibility of at least one of the federal economic programs:  
  • **Federal Skilled Worker Class (FSW)**  
  • **Federal Skilled Trades Class (FST)**  
  • **Canadian Experience Class (CEC)**  
- After provincial nomination, the applicant receives **600 additional CRS points**, substantially increasing chances of receiving an Invitation to Apply (ITA) for permanent residence.

4. General Provincial and Territorial Participants
All provinces and territories participate in the PNP, except Quebec and Nunavut.  
Participating jurisdictions include:  
- Alberta  
- British Columbia  
- Manitoba  
- New Brunswick  
- Newfoundland and Labrador  
- Northwest Territories  
- Nova Scotia  
- Ontario  
- Prince Edward Island  
- Saskatchewan  
- Yukon  

Each operates multiple PNP streams, such as skilled worker, international graduate, entrepreneur, and occupation-in-demand categories.

5. Admissibility Requirements
- Applicants and their accompanying family members must be **admissible to Canada** under the **Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA)** and **Regulations (IRPR)**.  
- Must pass **medical examinations**, **criminal background checks**, and **security screenings**.  

6. Documentation and Application Requirements
- **Nomination certificate** from the province or territory.  
- **Proof of language proficiency** (IELTS, CELPIP, or TEF, depending on program).  
- **Educational credential assessments (ECA)** for foreign education.  
- **Proof of work experience**, job offers, or business ownership (as applicable).  
- **Settlement plan** demonstrating intent to reside in the nominating province or territory.  
- **Proof of funds** to support settlement in Canada (unless exempt).  

7. Common Reasons for Ineligibility
- Failure to meet provincial nomination criteria.  
- Lack of intention to reside in the nominating province or territory.  
- Incomplete or inconsistent documentation.  
- Inadmissibility due to medical, security, or criminal reasons.  
- Misrepresentation or providing false information.

9. Notes
- The PNP is one of Canada’s most significant economic immigration pathways and provides opportunities for permanent settlement outside major urban centers.  
- A provincial nomination **does not automatically guarantee** permanent residence; IRCC conducts final admissibility assessments.  
- Applicants are expected to settle and work in the nominating province; moving immediately elsewhere may affect future applications.  
- Nominees and their families may apply for **Canadian citizenship** after meeting permanent residence requirements and residency obligations.
