Country: United States
Visa Category: Family-Based Immigrant Visa (Immediate Relatives of U.S. Citizens)

1. Overview  
The Family-Based Immigrant Visa for Immediate Relatives of U.S. Citizens allows qualifying family members to become lawful permanent residents (Green Card holders) without being subject to annual visa limits. Immediate relatives include the closest family members — spouses, unmarried children under 21, and parents of adult U.S. citizens.  

This category prioritizes family reunification, ensuring that U.S. citizens can sponsor their closest relatives for permanent residence in the United States.

2. Basic Eligibility Requirements  
- The beneficiary must be an **immediate relative of a U.S. citizen**.  
- The qualifying family relationship must legally exist and remain valid throughout the application process.  
- Eligible relationships include:  
  • **Spouse** of a U.S. citizen.  
  • **Unmarried child under 21 years of age** of a U.S. citizen.  
  • **Parent** of a U.S. citizen who is at least 21 years old.  
- The U.S. citizen petitioner must be able to prove the family relationship with legal documentation (birth certificate, marriage certificate, or adoption decree).  
- The beneficiary must be **admissible to the United States** or qualify for a waiver of inadmissibility if applicable.  
- The petitioner must meet the **financial sponsorship requirements** (Form I-864, Affidavit of Support).  

3. Relationship Definitions  
- **Spouse:** The marriage must be legally valid in the place where it was performed, and proof of a bona fide marital relationship must be submitted.  
- **Child:** Must be unmarried and under 21 years of age. Includes biological, step-, and adopted children meeting immigration law definitions.  
- **Parent:** The petitioning U.S. citizen must be at least 21 years old and provide evidence of the parental relationship (birth certificate or adoption record).  

4. Validity and Benefits  
- Once approved, the immediate relative becomes a **lawful permanent resident (Green Card holder)**.  
- There are **no annual numerical limits or waiting lists** for this category — visas are always available.  
- Permanent residents can live, work, and study in the United States indefinitely.  
- After meeting residency and other conditions, the beneficiary may apply for **U.S. citizenship** through naturalization.  
- Immediate relatives are eligible to apply for **adjustment of status** if already lawfully present in the U.S., or for **consular processing** abroad.  

5. Application Steps  
1. The U.S. citizen files **Form I-130 (Petition for Alien Relative)** with USCIS.  
2. Once approved, the beneficiary may either:  
   • File **Form I-485 (Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status)** if in the U.S., or  
   • Apply for an immigrant visa at a **U.S. embassy or consulate abroad** through the National Visa Center (NVC).  
3. Attend a biometrics appointment and interview (USCIS or consular).  
4. Upon approval, the beneficiary receives a **Green Card** as a lawful permanent resident.  

6. Key Documents Required  
- Form I-130, Petition for Alien Relative.  
- Proof of petitioner’s U.S. citizenship (U.S. passport, birth certificate, or naturalization certificate).  
- Evidence of qualifying family relationship (marriage, birth, or adoption certificate).  
- Form I-864, Affidavit of Support with financial proof.  
- Passport-style photographs of petitioner and beneficiary.  
- Form I-485 (for adjustment) or DS-260 (for consular processing).  
- Medical examination (Form I-693) and police certificates (if applicable).  

7. Common Reasons for Ineligibility  
- Failure to prove a valid immediate family relationship.  
- Petitioner not meeting age or citizenship requirements.  
- Fraudulent or sham marriage petitions.  
- Beneficiary deemed inadmissible due to criminal, medical, or immigration history.  
- Incomplete documentation or missing financial sponsorship.

9. Notes  
- Immediate relatives are **not subject to visa quotas**; their petitions are processed faster than preference categories.  
- Step and adopted relationships must meet strict legal age and custody requirements.  
- Beneficiaries already in the U.S. may file Form I-485 concurrently with I-130 if eligible.  
- The Child Status Protection Act (CSPA) may preserve eligibility for children who turn 21 before processing is complete.  
- Once granted a Green Card, immediate relatives may sponsor eligible family members after obtaining U.S. citizenship.
