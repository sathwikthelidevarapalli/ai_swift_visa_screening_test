Visa Category: Family-Based Immigrant Visa (Immediate Relatives of U.S. Citizens)

1. Overview  
The Family-Based Immigrant Visa program for immediate relatives of U.S. citizens enables U.S. citizens to petition for certain close family members to live and work permanently in the United States. These “immediate relatives” are given the highest immigration priority and are not subject to annual visa quotas or numerical limits.  

Immediate relative categories include spouses, unmarried children under 21 years of age, and parents of U.S. citizens aged 21 or older. The goal of this program is to promote family reunification and strengthen familial ties among U.S. citizens and their closest family members.

2. Basic Eligibility Requirements  
- The petitioner must be a **U.S. citizen** (lawful permanent residents are not eligible to file under the immediate relative category).  
- The qualifying relationship must be proven with official documentation such as a **birth certificate, marriage certificate, or adoption decree**.  
- The petitioner must be at least **21 years old** to file a petition for parents or siblings.  
- Immediate relative categories for which a U.S. citizen can petition include:  
  • **Spouse** of a U.S. citizen.  
  • **Unmarried child** under 21 years of age.  
  • **Parent(s)** (if the petitioner is 21 years of age or older).  
  • **Married or unmarried sons and daughters** (who may fall into family preference categories if not qualifying as immediate relatives).  
  • **Brothers and sisters** (if the petitioner is 21 or older; these are not immediate relatives but part of the family preference system).  
- The beneficiary must be **admissible to the United States** or eligible for a waiver of inadmissibility.  
- Applicants applying from within the U.S. must have been **lawfully inspected and admitted** or **inspected and paroled** into the country to adjust status.

3. Relationship Definitions  
- **Spouse:** The marriage must be legally valid in the place where it occurred. Proof of a bona fide marital relationship is required.  
- **Child:** Must be unmarried and under 21 years of age. Includes biological, step, or adopted children who meet USCIS legal definitions.  
- **Parent:** The petitioner must be 21 or older and must prove the biological or legal parental relationship.  
- **Sibling:** The petitioner must be 21 or older and share at least one common parent with the sibling being sponsored.  

4. Validity and Benefits  
- Once approved and admitted, the immediate relative becomes a **lawful permanent resident (Green Card holder)**.  
- There are **no annual limits or waiting periods** for visa issuance in the immediate relative category.  
- Green Card holders may live, work, and study permanently in the United States.  
- After meeting residency and other eligibility requirements, they may apply for **U.S. citizenship** through naturalization.  
- Derivative benefits (such as for children of the sponsored person) are not available under the immediate relative category; each eligible family member requires a separate petition.  

5. Application Steps  
1. The U.S. citizen files **Form I-130 (Petition for Alien Relative)** with USCIS.  
2. Once approved, if the beneficiary is outside the U.S., the case is transferred to the **National Visa Center (NVC)** for consular processing.  
3. The beneficiary completes **Form DS-260** (Immigrant Visa Application) and attends a visa interview at a U.S. embassy or consulate.  
4. If the beneficiary is in the U.S., they may apply for **adjustment of status (Form I-485)** concurrently or after I-130 approval.  
5. Upon approval, the beneficiary receives permanent resident status and a Green Card.  

6. Key Documents Required  
- Form I-130, Petition for Alien Relative.  
- Proof of petitioner’s U.S. citizenship (passport, birth certificate, or naturalization certificate).  
- Evidence of the qualifying family relationship (birth certificate, marriage certificate, or adoption decree).  
- Proof of lawful admission (I-94 record, visa stamp, or parole documentation for adjustment applicants).  
- Form I-864, Affidavit of Support with supporting financial documentation.  
- Passport-style photos of both petitioner and beneficiary.  
- Police certificates, medical examination, and civil records for consular processing cases.  

7. Common Reasons for Ineligibility  
- Failure to prove a valid family relationship.  
- Petitioner not meeting the age requirement (under 21 for parent/sibling petitions).  
- Prior fraudulent marriage or immigration violations.  
- Beneficiary found inadmissible due to criminal, medical, or immigration history.  
- Incomplete or inaccurate documentation.  
- Failure of the petitioner to meet income or financial support requirements.

9. Notes  
- Immediate relatives are **not subject to visa quotas**, which means visas are always available.  
- Beneficiaries who entered the U.S. unlawfully generally cannot adjust status unless covered by Section 245(i) or other specific provisions.  
- Step relationships and adoptions must meet all statutory age and custody requirements.  
- Marriage fraud detection measures may include interviews and documentary evidence to verify the legitimacy of the relationship.  
- The Child Status Protection Act (CSPA) may preserve eligibility for certain children who turn 21 during processing.
