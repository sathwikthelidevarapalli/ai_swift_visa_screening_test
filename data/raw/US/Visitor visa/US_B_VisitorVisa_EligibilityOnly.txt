The H-2A Temporary Agricultural Worker visa program allows U.S. employers or authorized agents to bring foreign nationals to the United States to fill temporary or seasonal agricultural jobs when there are not enough domestic workers available. The program ensures the lawful admission of foreign workers while protecting the employment conditions of U.S. workers in similar occupations.

The H-2A visa is employer-specific and valid only for the duration and location specified in the approved petition and labor certification.
