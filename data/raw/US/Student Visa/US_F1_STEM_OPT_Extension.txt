Visa Type: F-1 STEM Optional Practical Training (STEM OPT Extension)

1. Overview  
The STEM Optional Practical Training (STEM OPT) Extension allows eligible F-1 students who have completed degrees in Science, Technology, Engineering, or Mathematics (STEM) fields to extend their post-completion OPT by 24 months.  

This extension provides additional time for graduates to gain practical training directly related to their degree field while maintaining lawful F-1 student status. It also supports U.S. employers in retaining high-skilled graduates in technical fields.

2. Basic Eligibility Requirements  
- The student must **currently hold valid F-1 visa status** and be in an authorized period of **post-completion OPT**.  
- The student must have earned a **bachelor’s, master’s, or doctoral degree** in a **STEM field** included on the **DHS STEM Designated Degree Program List**.  
- The degree must have been conferred by an **accredited U.S. institution** certified by the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP).  
- The student must be **employed by or have a job offer from an employer enrolled in E-Verify**.  
- Employment must be **paid, full-time (at least 20 hours per week)**, and **directly related to the STEM degree field**.  
- The student and employer must complete and comply with **Form I-983 (Training Plan for STEM OPT Students)**.  
- The total period of unemployment during all OPT (initial and STEM extension combined) may not exceed **150 days**.  

3. Employer Requirements  
- The employer must be **actively registered in the E-Verify program** and remain in good standing.  
- The employer must provide structured and guided practical training consistent with the objectives listed in **Form I-983**.  
- The employer must agree to **supervise and evaluate** the student’s progress throughout the training period.  
- The employer must **report any material changes or termination** of the student’s employment to the DSO within five business days.  
- The employer must not use the student to replace a U.S. worker and must ensure wage parity with similarly situated employees.  

4. Validity and Duration  
- The STEM OPT Extension grants **an additional 24 months** of work authorization beyond the initial 12-month post-completion OPT, for a total of **36 months** of practical training.  
- The extension period begins immediately after the expiration of the student’s initial OPT.  
- Students may apply for the extension **up to 90 days before** their current OPT end date and must file **Form I-765** before the current EAD expires.  
- While the extension application is pending, students may continue working for up to **180 days beyond the initial OPT expiration date** if the I-765 is timely filed.  

5. Application Process  
1. Obtain recommendation for the STEM OPT Extension from your **Designated School Official (DSO)**, who will issue an updated **Form I-20** endorsing the extension.  
2. Complete **Form I-983 (Training Plan)** with your employer.  
3. File **Form I-765 (Application for Employment Authorization)** with USCIS before your current OPT Employment Authorization Document (EAD) expires.
