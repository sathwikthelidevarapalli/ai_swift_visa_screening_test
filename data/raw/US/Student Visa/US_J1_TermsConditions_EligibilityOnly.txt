Country: United States
Visa Type: J-1 Exchange Visitor

1. Overview  
The J-1 Exchange Visitor Program is a nonimmigrant visa category that allows individuals to participate in U.S. Department of State–designated exchange programs for purposes such as teaching, studying, conducting research, receiving training, or participating in cultural exchange.  

Under USCIS policy guidance, the duration of stay, terms of participation, and post-completion rules are defined to ensure lawful compliance and adherence to exchange program objectives.

2. Admission and Duration of Status  
- J-1 exchange visitors are admitted to the United States for the **duration of their exchange program** as indicated on **Form DS-2019 (Certificate of Eligibility)**.  
- In addition to the program period, participants are granted a **30-day grace period** following program completion to prepare for departure, travel within the U.S., or change of status (if eligible).  
- During this grace period, participants **cannot engage in employment or program activities** unless authorized under their valid program.  

3. Departure and Program Completion  
- Exchange visitors must **depart the United States no later than 30 days** after the completion of their program unless they have obtained:  
  • An approved **change of status** to another visa classification; or  
  • A **waiver** of the two-year home-country physical presence requirement (if applicable).  
- Overstaying beyond the grace period results in **loss of J-1 status** and may affect future immigration eligibility.  

4. Two-Year Home-Country Physical Presence Requirement (INA §212(e))  
- Certain J-1 exchange visitors are **subject to a two-year home residency requirement**, meaning they must reside physically in their **home country for at least two years** before they become eligible to apply for certain U.S. visa categories or permanent residence.  
- The requirement generally applies to individuals who:  
  • Received U.S. government or home-country government funding for their program;  
  • Participated in programs involving specialized knowledge or skills needed in their home country; or  
  • Received graduate medical education or training in the United States.  
- Affected participants **cannot change status** to an H visa, L visa, K visa, or apply for an immigrant visa until the two-year requirement is satisfied or officially waived.  

5. Waiver of the Two-Year Rule  
- A waiver may be requested under one or more of the following grounds:  
  • **No Objection Statement** from the applicant’s home government;  
  • **Interested U.S. Government Agency (IGA) Request**;  
  • **Persecution** based on race, religion, or political opinion;  
  • **Exceptional Hardship** to a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident spouse or child;  
  • **Conrad 30 Program** for certain physicians working in underserved areas.  
- Approval of a waiver does not automatically change the visa status; the applicant must still file a change of status application if intending to remain in the United States under a different visa category.  

6. Maintaining Status  
- Participants must **remain under the supervision of their program sponsor** throughout the duration of their stay.  
- Any changes to program activity, site of activity, or category must be approved by the program sponsor and updated in SEVIS.  
- Exchange visitors must **maintain valid health insurance** meeting the minimum J-1 regulatory requirements.  
- Employment is allowed only if **authorized** as part of the J-1 program or by the Responsible Officer.  

7. Dependents (J-2 Status)  
- Spouses and unmarried children under 21 years old may accompany or join the J-1 principal as **J-2 dependents**.  
- J-2 dependents may apply for **employment authorization (Form I-765)**, provided their income is not intended to support the J-1 participant.  
- J-2 dependents are generally subject to the same home-country physical presence requirement as the principal J-1 exchange visitor.

9. Notes  
- The 30-day grace period applies uniformly across all J-1 categories and is strictly non-extendable.  
- Waivers under INA 212(e) do not automatically adjust status; further filing with USCIS is required.  
- Any violation of J-1 terms (unauthorized employment, non-participation, or SEVIS noncompliance) results in termination of status.  
- Sponsors are responsible for monitoring compliance and reporting any program deviations to the Department of State and USCIS.
