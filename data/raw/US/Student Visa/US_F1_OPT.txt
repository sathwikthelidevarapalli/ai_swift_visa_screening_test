Visa Type: F-1 Optional Practical Training (OPT)

1. Overview  
Optional Practical Training (OPT) is a form of temporary employment authorization available to F-1 students that allows them to gain practical experience in their field of study. It is designed to provide students with real-world training directly related to their academic program at a SEVP-certified institution.  

OPT can be authorized during or after completion of a degree program and is intended to help students bridge the gap between academic study and professional employment.

2. Basic Eligibility Requirements  
- The applicant must currently hold **valid F-1 visa status** and be enrolled in a full course of study at a **SEVP-certified school**.  
- The applicant must have **completed at least one full academic year** of study before applying for OPT.  
- The student must be pursuing an eligible **degree, diploma, or certificate program**.  
- The proposed employment must be **directly related to the student’s major field of study**.  
- The student must apply for OPT **before beginning employment**.  
- Students who have completed **12 or more months of full-time Curricular Practical Training (CPT)** are **not eligible** for OPT.  
- The student must **maintain lawful F-1 status** during the entire OPT application and employment period.  

3. Types of OPT  
- **Pre-Completion OPT:** Available while the student is still pursuing their studies. Work may be part-time (up to 20 hours per week) during school sessions or full-time during breaks.  
- **Post-Completion OPT:** Available after the student has completed their degree program. Full-time employment is permitted.  
- **STEM OPT Extension:** Eligible students with degrees in Science, Technology, Engineering, or Mathematics (STEM) may apply for a **24-month extension** of post-completion OPT, if employed by a **E-Verify registered employer**.  

4. Validity and Duration  
- Students may be authorized for up to **12 months of full-time OPT** at each higher education level (bachelor’s, master’s, doctoral).  
- STEM graduates may qualify for an **additional 24-month extension** of OPT (for a total of 36 months).  
- The employment start date must be within **60 days of completing the academic program**.  
- OPT authorization is granted by **USCIS** upon approval of Form I-765 (Application for Employment Authorization).  

5. Application Process  
1. Obtain recommendation for OPT from your **Designated School Official (DSO)** and receive an updated Form I-20 indicating OPT request.  
2. File **Form I-765 (Application for Employment Authorization)** with USCIS before the end of your 60-day grace period after program completion (for post-completion OPT).  
3. Include the required filing fee, Form I-20 copy, passport, visa, I-94 record, and passport-style photos.  
4. Await approval and issuance of the **Employment Authorization Document (EAD)**.  
5. Begin work only after receiving the **EAD** and the start date listed on it.  

6. Key Documents Required  
- Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization.  
- Form I-20 with DSO endorsement for OPT.  
- I-94 Arrival/Departure Record.  
- Copy of valid passport and F-1 visa.  
- Passport-style photos meeting USCIS specifications.  
- Filing fee payment or approved fee waiver.  
- Job offer letter (if applicable, though not required for initial filing).  

7. Common Reasons for Ineligibility or Denial  
- Filing OPT application after the program completion deadline or beyond the 60-day grace period.  
- Completion of 12 or more months of full-time Curricular Practical Training (CPT).  
- Employment not directly related to the field of study.  
- Violation of F-1 student status or unauthorized employment.  
- Missing or incomplete documentation in Form I-765 submission.

9. Notes

- USCIS may deny OPT if filing deadlines or SEVIS data updates are not met.
