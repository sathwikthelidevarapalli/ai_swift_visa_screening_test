The F-1, M-1, and J-1 visa categories allow eligible international students and exchange visitors to enter the United States temporarily for the purpose of study, training, or cultural exchange. Each visa type has distinct eligibility conditions based on the nature of the educational or exchange program.

- Unauthorized employment or failure to maintain full-time enrollment may result in **termination of SEVIS record** and loss of status.

6. Dependents
- Dependents (spouse and unmarried children under 21) may accompany the principal visa holder under **F-2, M-2, or J-2 status**.
