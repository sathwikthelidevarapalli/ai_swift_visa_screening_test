The Family Reunion Visa allows close family members of German citizens or foreign nationals residing lawfully in Germany to join them for long-term residence.  
This visa supports family unity under German residence law and enables eligible relatives to live together in Germany permanently or for the duration of the sponsor’s residence permit.
