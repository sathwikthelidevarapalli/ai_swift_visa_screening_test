- The **sponsor (spouse in Germany)** must have sufficient accommodation and financial means to support both partners without depending on public funds.  
- The **local immigration authority (Ausländerbehörde)** in Germany must approve the family reunification before the visa can be issued by the German mission abroad.

- Upon arrival, the applicant must register their residence and apply for a **residence permit** at the **local Foreigners’ Office (Ausländerbehörde)**.  
- The residence permit is typically valid for **the same duration as the sponsor’s permit** or, for spouses of German citizens, issued with long-term renewal eligibility.  
- After several years of lawful residence, the applicant may qualify for a **permanent settlement permit** or **German citizenship**, depending on integration progress.

2. Schedule an appointment at the **German embassy or consulate** in the applicant’s country of residence.  
3. Submit required documents proving marriage validity, income, and accommodation.  
4. The embassy forwards the application to the **local immigration authority** in Germany for approval.
