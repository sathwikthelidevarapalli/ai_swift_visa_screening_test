Country: United Kingdom
Visa Type: Adult Dependent Relative Visa (Family Visa)

1. Overview
The Adult Dependent Relative (ADR) Visa allows adults who require long-term personal care to join their close family members living permanently in the United Kingdom.  
It is intended for parents, grandparents, siblings, or adult children of a British citizen, settled person, or someone with refugee or humanitarian protection status.  
The visa ensures that dependents who cannot receive adequate care in their home country can live with and be supported by their family in the UK.

2. Basic Eligibility Requirements
- The applicant must be **aged 18 years or older** at the time of application.  
- The applicant must **require long-term personal care** due to age, illness, or disability.  
- The applicant must be **unable to obtain the required care** in their country of residence, either because it is unavailable, unaffordable, or inadequate.  
- The **UK-based sponsor** must be a:  
  • British or Irish citizen, or  
  • Person settled in the UK (holding Indefinite Leave to Remain, settled status, or permanent residence), or  
  • Individual granted refugee or humanitarian protection in the UK.  
- The sponsor must demonstrate the **ability to provide adequate support, accommodation, and personal care** without reliance on public funds.  
- The applicant must apply **from outside the UK**, unless extending an existing valid visa within the same category.  

3. Care and Medical Need Requirements
- The applicant must provide **independent medical evidence** confirming that they require long-term personal care for daily living activities (e.g., eating, dressing, mobility).  
- Care must be proven as **unavailable or unaffordable** in the applicant’s country of residence.  
- Supporting documentation may include:  
  • Medical reports or physician statements describing the condition.  
  • Evidence of failed attempts to arrange or afford local care.  
  • Proof of dependency on the UK sponsor for ongoing support.  

4. Financial and Accommodation Requirements
- The sponsor in the UK must:  
  • Provide **adequate accommodation** without recourse to public funds.  
  • Cover all **living expenses, care, and medical costs** for the applicant.  
  • Demonstrate sufficient financial means (income, savings, or assets).  
- The Home Office may request evidence such as:  
  • Bank statements or payslips.  
  • Tenancy agreements or property ownership proof.  
  • Undertakings confirming full financial responsibility.  

5. Validity and Duration
- The Adult Dependent Relative Visa grants **indefinite leave to enter** (ILE) if the sponsor is a British citizen or settled person.  
- If the sponsor holds **refugee status or humanitarian protection**, the visa duration matches the sponsor’s period of leave, with eligibility to apply for settlement later.  
- Applicants granted ILE can live permanently in the UK without time restrictions.  
- Dependents cannot normally work or claim public funds unless expressly authorized.

- The sponsor assumes lifelong financial responsibility for the applicant.  
- Once granted, the visa allows permanent residence but no automatic access to public benefits.  
- Appeals may be made to the **First-tier Tribunal (Immigration and Asylum Chamber)** in case of refusal.
