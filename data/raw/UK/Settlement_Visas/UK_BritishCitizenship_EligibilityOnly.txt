Visa/Status Type: British Citizenship (Naturalisation / Registration – Permanent Status)

1. Overview
British citizenship grants an individual the right to live, work, and study in the United Kingdom without immigration restrictions.  
It is obtained through naturalisation, registration, or birth, depending on eligibility and circumstances.  
Citizenship provides access to a British passport, voting rights, and full participation in civic life.  
The most common route is through **naturalisation**, typically after holding **Indefinite Leave to Remain (ILR)** or **Settled Status** for a qualifying period.

  • At least **5 years** immediately before applying; or

  • Have **no serious or recent criminal convictions**,  
  • Have **no history of immigration breaches** or deception in previous applications,  
  • Not be involved in activities contrary to the public good (e.g., terrorism, war crimes).  
- Minor or spent convictions are considered individually but can affect eligibility depending on severity and recency.

5. Residency and Presence Rules
- The applicant must provide documentation showing lawful residence during the qualifying period.  
- Absences from the UK are strictly limited:  
  • No more than **450 days** (5-year route) or **270 days** (3-year route) outside the UK.  
  • Must have been **physically present** in the UK on the day exactly **5 or 3 years** before the date of application.
