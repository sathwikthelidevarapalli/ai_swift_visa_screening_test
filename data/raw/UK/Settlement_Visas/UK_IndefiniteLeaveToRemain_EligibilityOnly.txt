Visa/Status Type: Indefinite Leave to Remain (Settlement / Permanent Residence)

1. Overview
Indefinite Leave to Remain (ILR) is the UK’s permanent residence status that allows a foreign national to live, work, and study in the UK without time limits.  
It is the main route to settlement for skilled workers, family members, and other long-term residents who have maintained lawful residence in the UK.  
Holding ILR is also a key eligibility requirement for applying for British citizenship.

2. Basic Eligibility Requirements
- The applicant must have **lived and worked in the UK legally for at least 5 years** under a qualifying visa category such as:  
  • Skilled Worker or Tier 2 (General) Visa.  
  • Family Visa (spouse, partner, or dependent of a British citizen or settled person).  
  • Global Talent, Innovator, or Investor Visa.  
  • Ancestry Visa or Long-Term Work Visa.  
- Applicants who have **resided continuously in the UK for 10 years** lawfully may apply under the **Long Residence Route**.  
- The applicant must have **maintained continuous lawful residence** and stayed within the permitted absence limits during the qualifying period.  
- The applicant must **meet the English language requirement** and pass the **“Life in the UK” test**, if aged 18 to 64.

3. Continuous Residence Requirement

  • Pass the **Life in the UK Test**, which assesses understanding of British culture, history, and values.  
  • Demonstrate **English proficiency** (CEFR level B1 or higher) through an approved test or a degree taught in English.  
- Exemptions apply to those under 18, over 65, or medically exempt due to physical or mental conditions.
